# Tic-tac-toe in React

Yet another round of the [tic-tac-toe game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) in a effort to learn the basics of React. For the time being I'm leaning heavily on the [tutorial in the React docs](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) with the following additions:

- configure webpack from scratch based on [`webpack-merge`](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge)
- separate components and helpers
- switch to [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- extract the game status into a component
- add [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) and [`react-testing-library`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library) for testing

## Getting Started

- `npm start` to run the app during development
- `npm run build` to bundle a production build
- `npm test` to run the tests
